# Factory Rise GUI Library
A simple GUI library for being used with [rust-SFML](https://github.com/jeremyletang/rust-sfml), developed specially for [Factory Rise](https://github.com/Factory-Rise/Factory-Rise).

## WIP
This is a work in progress project.

## History
Since rust-SFML currently (apil 2020) doesn't support some important opengl functions (Context::getFunction) and I can't use ImGUI on it, I decided to move on with awaiting to others do something and write my own GUI lib, that will be extremelly needed for my game.
